A couple of non-standard python packages are required to render this presentation.
They are best installed using `pip` in a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install jupyter sympy pythreejs ipython_genutils ipyvolume colorcet  sympy_plot_backends
```

Quarto can then be run within the virtual environment:

```
quarto render quarto.qmd
```

If quarto fails to start up, try

```
rm -rf /run/user/1000/jt/
```
